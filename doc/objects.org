** User
   Everyone needs to log in to edit, but can view for free
** Concept
   Just a labeled node.
** Concept Explanation
   Bunch of text, written in a markup language that is aware of relationships.
*** Points to User, Concept
** Concept Explanation Agree
   I think that this person's explaination is good
*** Points to User, Explanation
** Concept Explanation Comment
   I have some complement or criticism
*** Points to User, Explanation
** Dependency
   Just a directed edge connexcting two concepts
*** Points to Concept A, Concept Bbg
** Dependency Explaination
   Why is it important to learn one before the other?
** Dependency Explaination Agree
*** Points to User, Dependency
** Dependency Explaination Comment
*** Points to User, Dependency
* Graph-structure ideals
** Asymetric
   Dependencies are heavily one-way
** Anti-transitive
   Minimize redundancy
** Acyclic
   A cycle of concepts would be, in theory, impossible to learn
* Cloud Code
** Traversal algorithms
*** Generate learning plan
*** Show learning progress
** Janitor Robots
*** Research what wikipedia does
* Client actions
** GET
*** Search for concepts
*** Display concept explanations, with votes and expand comments
*** Display dependencies in both directions for a given concept
*** Expand depencency explainations, with votes and expand comments
** PUT
*** Create a new concept 
    First force a search and suggest possible duplicate
*** Explain a concept
    Suggest to create and mark up possible dependencies from
    explanation text
    Autogenerated dependencies get a default "referred to by
    explanation" depenceny explanation
*** Vote for and comment on concept explanations
*** Manually create a new dependency
    Requires an initial explanation
*** Further explain an existing dependency
*** Vote for concept and dependency explanations
* Explanation Markup Language (EML?)
  Probably really simple, but we can use hash tags to refer to a
  named concept, i.e. #algebra
* Overarching prinicples and ettiquitte
  It's a tool to help people learn concepts. Writing an explaination
  should be treated as designing a lesson plan. 
 
* Possible issues:
** Disambiguation
   Maybe tag each concept with a special kind of concept, called
   a "context". Maybe this is a field of study, like @chemistry
